This library include code examples in jupyter-lab format.  

# Main Examples
1. Manifold_Visual.ipynb- Simulate propogation of manifolds in feed-forward-networks (Figure #1 from the paper)
2. Optimal_Spacing_Analysis.ipynb- Find the optimal spacing for quantized activation functions numerically (Figure #2)
3. mnist_heatmap.ipynb- Train mnist with different network layers, quantization levels and initializations (Figure #3)
