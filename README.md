# Quantized Meanfield
This repository serves as supplementary for the paper:
*A mean field theory of quantized deep networks: A Mean Field Theory of Quantized Deep Networks: The Quantization-Depth Trade-Off.*  
And includes several tools to assist research of deep-neural-networks using statistical physics

# Requirements:
* Python 3.0
* Pytorch with Cuda (Tested with 1.0.1.post2)
* Jupyter (Lab)
* Standard python packages, including: numpy, matplotlib, scipy

# Usage
No installation required.  
The python files in "./src" includes several tools usage throughout the research.  
The jupyter-examples include examples, which utilizes several of those tools, and allow reproduction of the main figures in the paper.
